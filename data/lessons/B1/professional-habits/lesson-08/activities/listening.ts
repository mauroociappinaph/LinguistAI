    transcript: "Let me show you my home office setup. I have a standing desk with three monitors. This monitor in the center is my main screen—it's 32 inches with 4K resolution. Those two monitors on the sides are 27 inches each. My keyboard has mechanical switches, and it has RGB lighting that I can customize. These headphones have active noise cancellation, which is perfect for video calls. That microphone over there is a USB condenser mic for important presentations. I also have a webcam that has great low-light performance. My laptop has an M2 chip with 64GB of RAM. Under the desk, I have a cable management system. Those cables you see are all organized and labeled. This setup has everything I need for productive remote work.",
