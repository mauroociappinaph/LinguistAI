    transcript: "While cloud infrastructure offers incredible flexibility, it comes with complexity that on-premise solutions don't have. Although AWS provides more services than any competitor, the learning curve is steep. We're trading off simplicity for scalability. While this makes sense for large enterprises, smaller companies might find the overhead overwhelming. Although costs are variable with cloud, they can easily spiral without proper monitoring."

    transcript: "Our team debated microservices versus monolith for weeks. While microservices offer better scalability, they require significantly more DevOps expertise. Although we have that expertise, we're a small team. The trade-off between architectural elegance and operational burden was clear. While microservices might be the future, for our current size, a well-structured monolith is moresensible. We're sacrificing some scalability for simplicity, and that's the right call for now."
