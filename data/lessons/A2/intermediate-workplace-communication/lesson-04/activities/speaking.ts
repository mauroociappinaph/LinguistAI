export const speaking = "After evaluating React, Vue, and Angular—the three most popular frontend frameworks—I strongly recommend React for our new project. React, which is maintained by Meta, has the largest community and the most extensive ecosystem. This is crucial because we'll need third-party solutions for features that aren't core to our application. While Vue is easier to learn than React, our team is experienced enough to handle React's steeper learning curve. Angular, which is more opinionated than both React and Vue, is better suited for large enterprise teams that need strict structure. However, our startup values flexibility over structure, which makes React the better fit. From a hiring perspective, React developers are easier to find than Vue or Angular developers, which reduces our recruitment risk. The framework that offers the best balance of ecosystem, flexibility, and talent availability is clearly React. Therefore, React is the best choice for our needs.";
