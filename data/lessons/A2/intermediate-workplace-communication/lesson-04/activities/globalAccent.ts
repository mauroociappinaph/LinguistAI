    transcript: "In my experience, React is the most versatile framework we've worked with. It's more flexible than Angular, which is important for fast-moving startups. Vue, which I've used on smaller projects, is definitely easier to pick up, but React's ecosystem is so much larger that you can find solutions for almost anything. For teams that prioritize innovation and speed, React is clearly the best choice. The framework that gives you the most options and the biggest community support is React."

    transcript: "We evaluated all three major frameworks for our enterprise application. Angular, which is the most structured, was initially appealing. However, it's also the most complex to learn, which was a concern for our team. Vue is simpler than both React and Angular, but it has the smallest enterprise adoption. React, which sits in the middle, offered the best balance. It's more flexible than Angular but more established than Vue. For companies that need proven technology with strong community support, React is definitely the safest and the most reliable option."
