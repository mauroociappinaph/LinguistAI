It has the largest community, which means the most resources and tutorials available. React is also the most widely adopted framework in the industry, making it the easiest to hire for. While Vue is the simplest to learn and Angular is the most structured for large teams, React offers the best balance of flexibility and ecosystem support. It's currently the most popular framework according to the latest State of JS survey, and it has the most mature third-party library ecosystem. For our needs, React is undoubtedly the most suitable option.";
