    transcript: "When I explain cloud computing to clients, I use a simple analogy. Think of cloud computing as electricity. You don't generate your own electricity at home—you plug into the grid and pay for what you use. Similarly, with cloud computing, you don't maintain your own servers. You plug into AWS or Azure and pay for the resources you consume. It's as convenient as flipping a light switch instead of running your own power plant."

    transcript: "I like to explain Git using a time machine analogy. Think of Git as a time machine for your code. Every commit is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific moment. If you make a mistake, you can travel back to any previous snapshot, similar to how a time machine lets you visit the past. Branches are like parallel timelines where you can experiment without affecting the main timeline. It's as safe as having a backup plan for every decision."
