export const scenario = "You're in a technical discussion meeting where you need to recommend a framework for a new project. The team is considering React, Vue, and Angular.";

export const speaking = "In my opinion, React is better than Angular for this project because it has a larger ecosystem and our team is already familiar with it. While Vue is easier to learn than React, React is more suitable for our needs because we're building a large-scale application that requires flexibility. From a performance perspective, all three frameworks are highly performant, but React's virtual DOM is more mature than Vue's. Additionally, React has better TypeScript support than Angular, which is important for our codebase.";
