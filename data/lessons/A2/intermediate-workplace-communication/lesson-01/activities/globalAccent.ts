    transcript: "When comparing frameworks, I always tell junior developers that React is more popular than Vue in the job market here. However, Vue is easier to learn, so it's better for personal projects when you're starting out. Both are faster than Angular for most use cases, and they're both more flexible than older frameworks like Backbone. The key is understanding that no framework is universally better—each one is more suitable for specific scenarios."

    transcript: "Right, so I've been working with various frameworks for years. In my experience, TypeScript is significantly better than vanilla JavaScript for large codebases. It's more maintainable, catches errors earlier, and makes refactoring safer. Yes, there's a learning curve—it's more complex than JavaScript initially—but the long-term benefits are greater. Similarly, modern frameworks are more efficient than jQuery for building SPAs, though jQuery is still lighter for simple interactions."
