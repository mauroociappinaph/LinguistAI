Then, she looks at the high-level architecture. Finally, she breaks down the problem to find the specific component that is failing.\n\nBen uses a bottom-up approach. First, he looks at the error log to find the exact line of code that crashed. Then, he tests that small component in isolation. Finally, he builds up his understanding of how that component interacts with the rest of the system.",
