  text: "Imagine you have two 'brains' for learning. The Analytical Brain (explicit) is slow, conscious, and effortful. It loves rules and theories. The Intuitive Brain (implicit) is fast, automatic, and works without you realizing it. It loves patterns and examples. When you first learn a language in school, you use your Analytical Brain to memorize grammar. But to become fluent, you need to train your Intuitive Brain. You do this with lots of practice, listening, and reading. The goal is to make English feel as natural and instinctive as your first language.",
