    transcript: "Hey Sarah, I noticed you switched from Sublime Text to VS Code. What made you change? Well, I think VS Code is faster than Sublime for large projects. The IntelliSense is also better than what I had before. Plus, the extension marketplace is way more extensive. I prefer VS Code to Sublime now because it's more flexible and the integrated terminal is really convenient. I don't like switching between windows all the time. What about you? Do you prefer any specific editor?",
