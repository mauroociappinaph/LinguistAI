    transcript: "Welcome to your first day! Let me show you how to use our internal dashboard. First, go to the login page and enter your credentials. Click the blue Login button. This will take you to your main dashboard. On the left side, you'll see the navigation menu. Click on Projects to view all your assigned tasks. Scroll down to see more details. If you want to change your settings, click on the gear icon in the top right corner. Enter your preferences in the form and click Save. To log out, click on your profile picture and select Logout from the dropdown menu. It's pretty straightforward once you get used to it.",
