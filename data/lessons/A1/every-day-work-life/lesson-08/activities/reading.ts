        "Let me describe my current home office setup.\n\n" +
        "I **have** a 16-inch MacBook Pro as my main machine. **This** laptop **has** excellent performance for development work. " +
        "Next to it, I **have** two 27-inch monitors. **These** monitors **have** 4K resolution, which is perfect for coding and design work.\n\n" +
        "On my desk, **this** mechanical keyboard **has** Cherry MX Brown switches. I **prefer** it because it's quieter than my old keyboard. " +
        "My colleague **has** a different model with blue switches, but I find **those** too loud for video calls.\n\n" +
        "For audio, I **have** a pair of noise-canceling headphones. **These** headphones **have** a built-in microphone for meetings. " +
        "**That** microphone over there is my backup—it's a USB condenser mic for important presentations.\n\n" +
        "Under the desk, I **have** a cable management system. **Those** cables you see are all organized and labeled. " +
        "My router is in the corner. **That** router **has** Wi-Fi 6 support, so my connection is very stable.\n\n" +
        "Finally, I **have** an adjustable standing desk. **This** desk **has** preset height settings, which makes it easy to switch between sitting and standing throughout the day.\n\n" +
        "Overall, I'm very happy with **this** setup. It **has** everything I need for productive remote work!",
